A small card game, based on blackjack, but with skills that can completely change the game.

This game was made by connecting to a local database, so you will need to have the XAMP control panel and Apache enabled, as well as have a database with the tables indicated in the script attached to the repository.

First, when you enter the game, you'll need to log in or register.

Once registered, you can create a game and start playing.

When you're in the game, you can see all the cards the machine has except one card, so you have to play wisely and have a little luck to win.

On the other hand, there are different abilities you can use to win the game. When you start a game, you're given three wild cards, and each round, you have a 50% chance of getting a wild card.
